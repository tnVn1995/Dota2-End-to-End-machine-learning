## Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota2)
### Introduction
  Dota2 is developed from a custom map whose name is Dota. The map has been a part of Warcraft3, which was brought about by Blizzard. Dota was at the time ["likely the most popular and most-discussed free, non-supported game mod in the world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients).In 2011, Valve Corporation hired Ice Frog (he created Dota) to develop an independent game based on the custom map Dota of Wardcraft3. The was when Dota2 appeared. In 2012, Valve launched a beta public version of Dota2. I was among the first wave of people to receive the keys to the beta. During this time, there were still many reservations from Dota players around the world about the potential success of Dota2. Hence, the players didn't immediately switch to Dota2 after the beta launch. Nonetheless, as time goes by, Dota2 proves to be the derserved heir to the world wide popular status of Dota. In 2006, Dota2 reached its record high peak when there were "nearly 1.29 million gamers playing at the same time." (https://www.statista.com/statistics/807457/dota-2-number-players-steam/). 
  
### Why I Analyze Dota2  
  As its popularity rises, so does its potential profit. Numerous tournaments have been hosted throughout its existence that have attracted millions of people watching worldwide. Most notably is the Internationl (TI) hosted by Valve Corporation every year. Each time TI is hosted, it sets a record high of the tournament prizepool. This year is no exception. The final prizepool for TI8 (which is this year) was over [25 million dollars](http://dota2.prizetrac.kr/international2018). In addition, the game proves to be an increasingly desirable career for many. As annual salaries for players in top performing teams come in a six figure number. Together with the prizepool winning money and sponsorships, players can expect to make millions of dollars per year. As a result, there arises a need to understand how to maximize the winning chances of a Dota2 game. Hence, I want to work on a data analysis of Dota2. The result of this analysis could contribute to a deeper understanding of how Dota2 works, therefore, optimizing the best strategy to win a match. This analysis could help both professional players as well as non-professional ones.  
### The Data
All of the data used for my analysis is taken from [Opendota](https://www.opendota.com). Opendota provides great API for interested developers. I got the data from GET requests to the API using python. Then, I loaded the data into my resultss.csv file. The csv file can be found [here](https://github.com/tung2921/My-Portfolio/tree/master/data).
